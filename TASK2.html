        <h3 class="section-heading">BENEFITS</h3>
        <ul><li><textsize="50">
1. Control Weight Gain
One of the major benefits of sporting activities is it helps you to control weight gain. A sedentary job and an 
unhealthy lifestyle are some of the main causes of obesity. Obese people have a higher risk of hypertension and 
heart diseases. If obese people involve themselves in sports that demand intense physical activity, they can 
burn more calories, shed extra body and reduce the chances of unnecessary weight gain. Thus, they can ensure 
and maintain a good physique. Choosing the right sport as per your health conditions and following a balanced 
diet can help individuals control weight gain.</li>

<li>2. Lower Cholesterol Levels
Another health benefit of sports is it helps to control cholesterol levels. People who are involved in physical activities like sports have lower cholesterol levels in comparison to those who do not actively participate in sports or other physical activities.</li>

<li>3. Improve Blood Circulation
Sport is good for health as it helps to improve blood circulation. Any kind of sports game requires active participation, which increases haemoglobin and blood volume.</li>

<li>4. Reduce Hypertension
Hypertension or high blood pressure is a major health risk that can cause stroke and other heart-related issues. Playing sports helps to keep the blood pressure normal.  Almost all kinds of sports demands running, stretching and other physical activities. When you perform such activities, it makes your heart stronger, and the force on arteries decreases, which reduces blood pressure. Thus, by participating in sports, you can efficiently manage your blood pressure level.</li>

<li>5. Stronger immunity
Sports and regular exercise improve the White Blood Cells level. White Blood Cells (WBCs) are the primary agent of the body that fights disease. Moderate to high-intensity exercises improve blood circulation, which enhances the immunity system. Sports and regular movement helps to combat pathogens and other harmful organisms.  Hence, stronger immunity gets into the list of health benefits of playing sports.</li>

<li>6. Stronger Muscles
If you are willing to have a proper muscle workout, you can get involved in sports-related activities. Muscle training activities such as lifting weights can help to maintain muscle mass and strength. Further, through sports like soccer, tennis, baseball, you can tone your muscles and train them to work in a perfect manner. This is known as neuromuscular programming. The longer you stay active in sports, the more your muscles improve and stay stronger. Also, playing sports help to tone your muscles and burn fat simultaneously.</li>

<li>7. Stronger Bones
The list of physical benefits of sports for your health includes stronger bones. While participating in any kind of sports, you put stress on your bones with maximum strength movements, which helps increase bone density and make bones stronger. For instance, if you put additional stress on bones, the increased level of pressure enables bones to adapt to this condition and become denser. Therefore, if you continue this intense activity for a long duration, your bones get stronger. With advancing age, bone density reduces, but if individuals keep themselves involved in light sports, they can maintain a good bone density level.</li></ul>
